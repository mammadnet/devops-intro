# DevOps Intro

A collection of practical notes and guides about **DevOps**, covering essential tools and concepts used in modern software delivery.

This project builds a **documentation website** that organizes DevOps knowledge into clear, connected sections — from basic concepts to advanced automation. It turns Markdown notes into a structured learning site, making it easy to explore and share DevOps practices.

## 🧩 Topics Covered

- **DevOps Fundamentals** — principles, culture, and collaboration between development and operations  
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** — automation with Terraform, Ansible, and configuration management  
- **Containers** — using Docker and Docker Compose to build, run, and manage applications  
- **CI/CD Pipelines** — automating builds, tests, and deployments with GitHub Actions  
- **Kubernetes Basics** — deploying, scaling, and managing containerized workloads  
- **Monitoring & Observability** — understanding metrics, logs, and tracing tools  
- **Networking & Cloud Concepts** — how cloud infrastructure and networking fit into DevOps  
- **Before DevOps** — what problems DevOps solves and how the mindset evolved
